This is a python based proof of concept project. This pair of programs uses a One Time Pad based on a preshared key to authenticate a string (message, command, etc) sent over an unencrypted, noisy channel. This could be used to authenticate commands sent over an amateur radio link, where encryption is not legal (or at least highly discouraged).
